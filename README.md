# ðŸ”¥ Learning Interpretability Tool (LIT)

<!--* freshness: { owner: 'lit-dev' reviewed: '2023-06-27' } *-->

The Learning Interpretability Tool (ðŸ”¥LIT, formerly known as the Language
Interpretability Tool) is a visual, interactive ML model-understanding tool that
supports text, image, and tabular data. It can be run as a standalone server, or
inside of notebook environments such as Colab, Jupyter, and Google Cloud Vertex
AI notebooks.

LIT is built to answer questions such as:

*   **What kind of examples** does my model perform poorly on?
*   **Why did my model make this prediction?** Can this prediction be attributed
    to adversarial behavior, or to undesirable priors in the training set?
*   **Does my model behave consistently** if I change things like textual style,
    verb tense, or pronoun gender?

![Example of LIT UI](documentation/images/figure-1.png)

LIT supports a variety of debugging workflows through a browser-based UI.
Features include:

*   **Local explanations** via salience maps, attention, and rich visualization
    of model predictions.
*   **Aggregate analysis** including custom metrics, slicing and binning, and
    visualization of embedding spaces.
*   **Counterfactual generation** via manual edits or generator plug-ins to
    dynamically create and evaluate new examples.
*   **Side-by-side mode** to compare two or more models, or one model on a pair
    of examples.
*   **Highly extensible** to new model types, including classification,
    regression, span labeling, seq2seq, and language modeling. Supports
    multi-head models and multiple input features out of the box.
*   **Framework-agnostic** and compatible with TensorFlow, PyTorch, and more.

LIT has a [website](https://pair-code.github.io/lit) with live demos, tutorials,
a setup guide and more.

*   [Release notes](./RELEASE.md)

## Download and Installation

LIT can be run via container image, installed via `pip` or built from source.
Building from source is necessary if you update any of the front-end or core
back-end code.

### Build container image

Build the image using `docker` or `podman`:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/PAIR-code/lit.git && cd lit
docker build --file Dockerfile --tag lit-nlp .
```

See the [advanced guide](documentation/docker.md) for detailed instructions on using the
default LIT Docker image, running LIT as a containerized web app in different
scenarios, and how to creating your own LIT images.

### pip installation

```sh
pip install lit-nlp
```

The `pip` installation will install all necessary prerequisite packages for use
of the core LIT package.

It **does not** install the prerequisites for the provided demos, so you need to
install those yourself. See [environment.yml](./environment.yml) for the list of
packages required to run the demos.

### Install from source

Clone the repo and set up a Python environment:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/PAIR-code/lit.git && cd lit

# Set up Python environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pip install cudnn cupti  # optional, for GPU support
python -m pip pytorch  # optional, for PyTorch

# Build the frontend
(cd lit_nlp; yarn && yarn build)
```

Note: if you see [an error](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/2821)
running `yarn` on Ubuntu/Debian, be sure you have the
[correct version installed](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#linux-tab).


## Running LIT

Explore a collection of hosted demos on the
[LIT website demos page](https://pair-code.github.io/lit/demos).

### Quick-start: classification and regression

To explore classification and regression models tasks from the popular
[GLUE benchmark](https://gluebenchmark.com/):

```sh
python -m lit_nlp.examples.glue_demo --port=5432 --quickstart
```

Or, using `docker`:

```sh
docker run --rm -e DEMO_NAME=glue_demo -p 5432:5432 -t lit-nlp --quickstart
```

Navigate to http://localhost:5432 to access the LIT UI.

Your default view will be a
[small BERT-based model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08962) fine-tuned on the
[Stanford Sentiment Treebank](https://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/treebank.html),
but you can switch to
[STS-B](http://ixa2.si.ehu.es/stswiki/index.php/STSbenchmark) or
[MultiNLI](https://cims.nyu.edu/~sbowman/multinli/) using the toolbar or the
gear icon in the upper right.

### Quick-start: language modeling

To explore predictions from a pre-trained language model (BERT or GPT-2), run:

```sh
python -m lit_nlp.examples.lm_demo --models=bert-base-uncased --port=5432
```

Or, using `docker`:

```sh
docker run --rm -e DEMO_NAME=lm_demo -p 5432:5432 -t lit-nlp --models=bert-base-uncased
```

And navigate to http://localhost:5432 for the UI.

### Notebook usage

Colab notebooks showing the use of LIT inside of notebooks can be found at
google3/third_party/py/lit_nlp/examples/notebooks.

We provide a simple
[Colab demo](https://colab.research.google.com/github/PAIR-code/lit/blob/main/lit_nlp/examples/notebooks/LIT_sentiment_classifier.ipynb).
Run all the cells to see LIT on an example classification model in the notebook.

### More Examples

See [lit_nlp/examples](./lit_nlp/examples). Run similarly to the above:

```sh
python -m lit_nlp.examples.<example_name> --port=5432 [optional --args]
```

## User Guide

To learn about LIT's features, check out the [user guide](documentation/ui_guide.md), or
watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuRI_VK83dU).

## Adding your own models or data

You can easily run LIT with your own model by creating a custom `demo.py`
launcher, similar to those in [lit_nlp/examples](./lit_nlp/examples). The
basic steps are:

*   Write a data loader which follows the [`Dataset` API](documentation/api.md#datasets)
*   Write a model wrapper which follows the [`Model` API](documentation/api.md#models)
*   Pass models, datasets, and any additional
    [components](documentation/api.md#interpretation-components) to the LIT server class

For a full walkthrough, see
[adding models and data](documentation/api.md#adding-models-and-data).

## Extending LIT with new components

LIT is easy to extend with new interpretability components, generators, and
more, both on the frontend or the backend. See our [documentation](documentation/index.md) to get
started.

## Pull Request Process

To make code changes to LIT, please work off of the `dev` branch and
[create pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
(PRs) against that branch. The `main` branch is for stable releases, and it is
expected that the `dev` branch will always be ahead of `main`.

[Draft PRs](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/) are
encouraged, especially for first-time contributors or contributors working on
complex tasks (e.g., Google Summer of Code contributors). Please use these to
communicate ideas and implementations with the LIT team, in addition to issues.

Prior to sending your PR or marking a Draft PR as "Ready for Review", please run
the Python and TypeScript linters on your code to ensure compliance with
Google's [Python](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) and
[TypeScript](https://google.github.io/styleguide/tsguide.html) Style Guides.

```sh
# Run Pylint on your code using the following command from the root of this repo
pushd lit_nlp & pylint & popd

# Run ESLint on your code using the following command from the root of this repo
pushd lit_nlp & yarn lint & popd
```

## Disclaimer

This is not an official Google product.

LIT is a research project and under active development by a small team. There
will be some bugs and rough edges, but we're releasing at an early stage because
we think it's pretty useful already. We want LIT to be an open platform, not a
walled garden, and we would love your suggestions and feedback - drop us a line
in the [issues](https://github.com/pair-code/lit/issues).
